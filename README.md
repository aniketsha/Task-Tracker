Objective:
The primary goal of the "Task Tracker" project was to develop a comprehensive website using the Java Spring Boot framework. The objective encompassed organizing, rendering, and retrieving information related to tasks, coupled with the added functionality of serving as a shopping cart for task-related items.

How:
The implementation strategy involved the adept utilization of CRUD operations and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The project structure included distinct folders for templates containing HTML, CSS, and JS files, along with separate directories for controllers and beans to manage classes efficiently. Security measures were implemented using an In-Memory database, specifically H2, to fortify the application against unauthorized access. Dependencies such as Thymeleaf and Lombok were seamlessly integrated to enhance functionality and code readability.
